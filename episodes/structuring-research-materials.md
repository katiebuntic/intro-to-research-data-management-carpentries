### Organising files into a folder structure

In groups, look through the folder of data that you have been given:

- What problems can you identify with how files are organised?
- How many different datasets can you identify?
- Which files are 'raw' vs 'processed' data?
- How would you improve the organisation of the files? E.g. how would you split them between different folders?
