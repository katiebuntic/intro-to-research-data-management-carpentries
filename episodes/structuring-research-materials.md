:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can you structure data using a standard folder system for better organisation?
- What are the benefits of using a consistent file naming convention in research data management?
- Why is version control important, and how can it be incorporated into file naming practices?
- In what ways can version control tools like Git and GitHub be useful for managing data?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Organise their research data into a standard folder structure
- Name files with a consistent naming convention
- Understand why version control is important, and how to incorporate this into your naming conventions
- Explain why version control software such as Git/GitHub can be useful for certain types of data.

## Folder systems

Alex has recently started a PhD on a project that has been running for a few years. He has been given access to the project's folders and has been asked by his supervisor to look through some files left by a researcher who recently left.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
### Organising files into a folder structure Part I

In groups, look through the folder of data that you have been given and discuss the following questions:

- What problems can you identify with how files are organised?
- How many different datasets can you identify?
- Which files are 'raw' vs 'processed' data?
- How would you improve the organisation of the files?


:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

When thinking about how you could improve the organisation of the files, consider whether it might be easier to split them between different folders and whether any might need renaming

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Alex goes to his supervisor and explains the problems he has found. His supervisor asks him to improve the organisation of the files as he is concerned that no-one will be able to find anything. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
### Organising files into a folder structure Part II

Individually, look at the folder of files again and within it create a set of folders to organise them into. You may want to create subfolders inside some of these folders too. Organise the files into your folders.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

Alex sees that during the project the researcher gave a presentation at a conference and that alongside the slides there are lots of documents relating to his attendance.
