:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can you structure data using a standard folder system for better organisation?
- What are the benefits of using a consistent file naming convention in research data management?
- Why is version control important, and how can it be incorporated into file naming practices?

## Folder systems

Alex has recently started a PhD on a project that has been running for a few years. He has been given access to the project's folders and has been asked by his supervisor to look through some files left by a researcher who recently left.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
### Organising files into a folder structure Part I

In groups, look through the folder of data that you have been given and discuss the following questions:

- What problems can you identify with how files are organised?
- How many different datasets can you identify?
- Which files are 'raw' vs 'processed' data?
- How would you improve the organisation of the files?


:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

When thinking about how you could improve the organisation of the files, consider whether it might be easier to split them between different folders and whether any might need renaming

Alex goes to his supervisor and explains the problems he has found. His supervisor asks him to improve the organisation of the files as he is concerned that no-one will be able to find anything. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
### Organising files into a folder structure Part II

Individually, look at the folder of files again and within it create a set of folders to organise each file into. You may want to create subfolders inside some of these folders too. Organise the files into your folders.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

- Alex sees that during the project the researcher gave a presentation at a conference and that alongside the slides there are lots of documents relating to his attendance. Think about the different ways files related to the conference might be stored and consider which might be better for a team needing to share files, versus how an individual might be happy to store them.
- There are also various files related to a data analysis: can you see the different stages of that analysis process? How might you organise them?

Poor organisation can make it difficult to find files or to even see that a specific file exists.  This can become a massive problem where multiple people are working together or on projects that run over a number of years. Out-of-date versions of files may end up being used and shared, and important documents effectively lost. Relying on search tools to find documents assumes that you know that the document exists, and that you know how it was named; if you weren't the person who created it how would you know about it? If you think back to documents you created a few years ago, would you still be able to say what they were all called, what the latest versions were called, and what they all related to?

Taking a few moments to think about the structures you use to store files can save a lot of stress, and time, both for you and anyone you work with. If you work across multiple projects it can be worth coming up with a consistent approach, so that you and anyone you work with always knows where in the folder structure to find the same types of files. Structure folders heirarchically too: start broad and drill-down into specific areas. It can be worth thinking of an old fashioned set of filing cabinets:

- each filing cabinet is a project
- each drawer is a an aspect of the project e.g. drawer 1 for data collection; drawer 2 for analysis; drawer 3 for papers and presentations
- within each drawer are folders containing files about specific subsections of that aspect e.g. in drawer 2 there are separate folders for code, raw data, cleaned data, graphs/ figures, and reports
- within each folder in each drawer there may be further sub-sections....

However, do be sensible about the level and number of folders you use: if you have lots of folders that only contain one file, you may have too many, making it more difficult and time-consuming to navigate. If you have very few folders then there may be too many files in a folder, making it difficult to find the relevant one.

Whatever structures you choose, it is worth preiodically reviewing them to make sure they're still fulfilling their purpose. Perhaps a section of the project can be archived? Perhaps there are now enough files of a particular type to necessitate a new section?
