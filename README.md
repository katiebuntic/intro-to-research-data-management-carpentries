# Introduction to Research Data Management Lesson

ðŸš§ This lesson is under development.

[Visit the lesson built from this repository](https://katiebuntic.github.io/intro-to-research-data-management-carpentries/).

### Lesson Description

This lesson aims to teach those just starting to undertake research how to manage their data and files.

#### Target Audience

- Masters/PhD/Postdoc researchers at the beginning of their projects.
- Basic digital skills required (e.g., file management, Excel, some version control exposure).
- No programming experience necessary.

#### Prerequisites

- Basic Excel use (open/save tables)
- File/folder management on a computer
- A research project or dataset in progress

### Learning Objectives

After completing this course, the learners should be able to:

* Define research data and distinguish between different data types.
* Structure research materials using clear file naming conventions and a logical folder hierarchy
* Describe methods of data collection that make data cleaner and easier to analyse
* Detect inconsistencies and errors in a tabular dataset ("dirty data")
* Use a set of basic techniques to remove/correct errors and inconsistencies in tabular data ("cleaning data")
* Use version control to track different versions of files, and switch between them.

### Dataset & Narrative

#### Dataset: MET Dataset, this is a subset of the original dataset.
* Link to original dataset: https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess
* Size: 
* Types: CSV file including string and numerical data
* Requires noise/messiness injection for teaching
* Licensing: CC0 1.0 Universal

### Episodes

ðŸš§ This needs some work.

**1. What is Research Data?**
   
  - Data types
  - Sources of data
  - What is research data management (collection, storage, organisation, sharing, etc)?

*Need to write objectives*
    
**2. Structuring research materials**
   
  - Naming conventions
  - Folder structures
  - Version Control
  - Introduction to version control software, Git/ Github

  **Objectives**
  
  After following this episode, learners will be able to:

  - Organise their research data into a standard folder structure
  - Name files with a consistent naming convention
  - Understand why version control is important, and how to incorporate this into your naming conventions
  - Explain why version control software such as Git/GitHub can be useful for certain types of data. 
  
**3. Tabular data collection**
   
  - Have a look at a 'dirty' data set
  - Is there a standard set of responses?
  - Is it free text?
  - How do you control what data is being collected?
  - Asking the right questions
  - Data dictionaries

  **Objectives**

  After following this episode, learners will be able to:

  - List variable types and formats
  - Identify inconsistencies in data that can cause problems during analysis
  - Describe methods that can be used during data collection and data entry that can prevent inconsistencies
  - Write guidance for how to collect and enter data
  - Create a data dictionary describing a dataset

**4. How to clean a tabular dataset (using Excel)**
   
  - Finding inconsistencies
  - Missing data
  - Capitalisation
  - Spelling mistakes
  - Pros and cons of Excel

  **Objectives**

  After following this episode, learners will be able to:
  
  - Describe what data cleaning is and why it is important
  - Find and resolve inconsistencies within a tabular dataset programmatically (e.g datetime, numeric precision)
  - Identify missing values within a tabular dataset using filters
  - Correct spelling mistakes using spell check tools and find + replace
  - Standardise text formats using spreadsheet functions
  - Describe the pros and cons of using spreadsheets for data collection and cleaning
  - [Note: update for using R?]

**5. Introduction to R**
