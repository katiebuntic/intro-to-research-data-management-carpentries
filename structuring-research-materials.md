## Folder systems

Alex has recently started a PhD on a project that has been running for a few years. He has been given access to the project's folders and has been asked by his supervisor to look through some files left by a researcher who recently left.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
### Organising files into a folder structure Part I

In groups, look through the folder of data that you have been given:

- What problems can you identify with how files are organised?
- How many different datasets can you identify?
- Which files are 'raw' vs 'processed' data?
- How would you improve the organisation of the files? E.g. how would you split them between different folders?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Alex goes to his supervisor and explains the problems he has found. His supervisor asks him to improve the organisation of the files as he is concerned that no-one will be able to find anything.
