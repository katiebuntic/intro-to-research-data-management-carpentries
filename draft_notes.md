## Exercises

#### 2. Structuring research materials

**Objective:** Organise their research data into a standard folder structure

**Exercise:** The students are given a zip file that has a messy folder with folders and documents within it, which are badly structured.

For the first objective, they organise the folders/files using the methods that we have learnt in the episode. For assessing, they can have a go themselves, then get into pairs/groups to dicuss, teachers and helpers are walking round the room (in person) or popping into breakout rooms (virtual). The teacher then goes through the 'ideal' answer with the big group.

**Objective:** Name files with a consistent naming convention

**Exercise:** Give a set of files/folders with names, and they need to state whether it is good or bad naming conventions and why. Examples of how hard it is to order the names (if bad), what are the versions etc..

#### 3. Tabular data collection

**Objective:** Identify inconsistencies in data such as ...

**Exercise:** A dataset is also in the zip file. The students download the data. They need to find the problem data within a dataset (e.g. using different measurements, free hand mistakes). For assessing, we check-in with the students. Each students comes up with an example and writes on Socrative, CodiMD (or a similar tool).

**Objective:** Describe methods that can be used during data collection and data entry that can prevent inconsistencies

**Exercise:** What do you think could have been changed in the way data has been collected to prevent these incosistences?

#### 4. How to clean a tabular dataset

**Objectives:** Find and programmatically resolve inconsistences within a tabular dataset (e.g datetime, numeric precision)

**Exercise:** The students would have gone through the methods of how to resolving inconsistences in the lesson. There would then be a dirty dataset and then a few multiple choice questions that they can do in socrative. For example, how many values have you corrected in the dataset? How many missing values are there in Col X?

### Examples before exercises
Use this space to make some notes about examples/narrative you could use to demonstrate the skills/teach the knowledge that learners will need to complete the exercise(s) you designed above. 

#### 1. Intro

**Objective:** Data types 

**Example**: Go through different 'movie' data. Scripts, Move images, video clips, audio files, filming location maps etc..

**Exercise:** Could get the students to think about what the other types of data there could be in Movie research.  

#### 2. Structuring research materials

**Objective:** Organise their research data into a standard folder structure

**Exercise:** The students are given a zip file that has a messy folder with folders and documents within it, which are badly structured.

**Example from narrative:** This can also be after the exercise to go through it together.

#### 3. Tabular Data collection

**Objective**: Data dictionaries 

**Example:** We would go through 20% of the data variables from the dataset that the class has been working with (or another dataset) and go through what a data dictionary is and why it is useful. Show a bad example and a good example and discuss why.

### 4. Data cleaning 

**Objective**: Standardise text formats using spreadsheet functions

**Examples:** Standardising the cases. We go through how to make all the data uppercase in our dataset then they have to do lowercase as their exercise.
